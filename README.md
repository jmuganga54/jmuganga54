# 👋 Hey there, I am Joseph Muganga  

I like to call myself a Health Data Scientist on a journey.  

I started out managing data for research projects, building electronic forms, and making sure every dataset was clean and trustworthy. Along the way, I found joy in showing others how to use digital tools for data collection like @getodk, and it opened my eyes to how powerful good data can be.  

These days, I spend more time digging into health datasets with Python and R, trying to make sense of messy numbers and turn them into stories that matter. For me, data is not just about charts and models, it is about guiding real decisions, shaping better health policies, and finding new ways to tackle challenges that affect people’s lives.

## 🔭 What I am up to now  
- Playing around with **Machine Learning, Statistics, and Data Visualisation**  
- Working on **health datasets** that test both my patience and curiosity  
- Supporting **digital data collection tools** (yes, I still love Open Data Kit)

## 🧭 What excites me  
- **Infectious Disease Modelling** — because understanding how diseases spread is the first step to stopping them  
- **Pharmacogenetics Modelling** — because our genes tell part of the story of how treatments work
- **Open Digital Tools for Health** — I am excited about building user friendly systems that make health research, data collection, and analysis more effective in solving real world challenges

## 🤝 Who I like to work with  
I enjoy working with people who share the same passion for data and health. That includes those exploring **health data projects** like infectious disease modelling, pharmacogenetics, or digital health solutions. I also enjoy teaming up with people building **open source tools** that make research more accessible, and anyone who believes in the power of data to solve real world health challenges.

⚡ **Fun fact:** I used to work in creative fields before diving into health data, so I bring a bit of design thinking into everything I do. And yes, I love mentoring others who are just starting their own data journey 🚀
